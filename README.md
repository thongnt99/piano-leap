###Computer Vision - Fall 2015 | VNU,H - UET
This is a course project for running piano simulation on web application featuring Leap Motion controller.

###Technologies
1. JavaScript
2. Leap Motion
3. MIDI.js
4. three.js

###Feature
1. Auto-play
2. Play by using keyboard
3. Play by using Leap Motion Controller, one finger mode and one hand mode.

###Installing
*NOTE:* 
* Because most of browsers disabled the cross-origin request, in this case the file:// request, so if you try to run index.html locally you will receive a blank page.
* To be able to use the Leap Motion feature, you will need a Leap Motion Controller and install the installer on your machine.

1. Run locally:
    * Get the source code
    * Run a local server on the machine and placing the source code inside. For example: XAMPP.
    * Start the website by navigating to the folder on the browser
    
2. Run on hosting: Same as above.
